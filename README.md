# Pandas-Challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Module 4 Challenge due on 11/12. 
All of the work present has been created by myself, Molly Pfefferkorn. 
My instructor, Dr. Carl Arrington, provided troubleshooting feedback during the designated office hours of this class. 
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

In this assignment, I completed an in-depth analysis of school district data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. This repository contains a folder named "PyCitySchools," which holds my Jupyter notebook with all the analysis scripts. The project involves analyzing standardized test results, school performance, and demographic data to assist in decision-making for a school district's future budget and priorities.

The analysis started with calculating high-level district-wide metrics, including the total number of unique schools, total students, total budget, and average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects overall. I then saved the results in a DataFrame titled "district_summary".

For each school, I calculated metrics such as total students, school budget, average scores, and passing rates, saving these results in a DataFrame called "per_school_summary".

I also identified the top and bottom-performing schools based on overall passing percentages, and created DataFrames called "top_schools" and "bottom_schools." 

To explore student performance by grade, I grouped data by grade level and school, calculating average math and reading scores for each grade, which were stored in separate DataFrames: "math_scores_by_grade" and "reading_scores_by_grade", respectively.

I then analyzed school performance based on spending, size, and type by using Pandasâ€™ pd.cut, categorizing schools into spending ranges and size categories, and calculating average scores for each group. I then summarized these results in the "spending_summary" and "size_summary" DataFrames. Finally, I created a "type_summary" DataFrame by grouping the data by school type (Charter or District).

After analyzing the results displayed in all of the DataFrames, I summarized my findings in the text field at the top of the Jupyter notebook.
